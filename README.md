Project One

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input for adding hours and minutes using secure and efficient C++ code.
