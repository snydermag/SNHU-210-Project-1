# SNHU-210-Project-1

Project One

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input for adding hours and minutes using secure and efficient C++ code.

In this project I am pleased with how much of my code I was able to complete before main function. It kept my code clean and organized. The most challenging thing about my code was getting the current time. I'm glad I was able to figure out a work around using resources I found online.
